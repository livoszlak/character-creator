# Character Creator

This is a .NET 8.0 application that allows you to outline some basic properties for a DnD character. It fetches data from the DnD5e open API. WIP.

## Project Structure

- `Application/`: Contains the main application logic.
- `DataModels/`: Contains the data models used in the application.
- `Services/`: Contains services for interacting with APIs and other external resources.

## Dependencies

- [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) version 13.0.3
- [Spectre.Console](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spectre.Console/) version 0.48.0
- [Spectre.Console.Cli](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spectre.Console.Cli/) version 0.48.0

## Comments

This is a work in progress. More logic needs to be added to create a full character, but this is a start!
